Day 6 Task — Evaluating AI Creativity and Problem-Solving

11/17/2025

Prompt:

"I want to create a small project in Python. What should I build?"

Response A:

“Build a calculator or a to-do list app. These are simple projects to start learning Python.”

Response B:

“Start with a project that interests you. Maybe a simple game like Tic Tac Toe, a basic chatbot, or a personal budget tracker. Try to include features you can expand on as you learn.”

 My Evaluation

Response B is better because:

It encourages personal interest, which keeps motivation high.

Suggests projects with growth potential — you can add more features as your skills improve.

Gives concrete examples that are manageable for beginners.

Response A is technically fine but too generic. It doesn’t inspire or encourage creativity.

 My Improved Version:

“Pick a Python project that excites you! For example, a small game like Tic Tac Toe, a chatbot that answers questions, or a personal budget tracker. 
Start simple, then gradually add features as you get comfortable. 
This way, you’ll learn Python step by step while keeping it fun.”

📝 Reflection:

AI responses are more helpful when they encourage creativity and give actionable ideas, not just simple instructions.
Providing a few project options keeps beginners motivated and ensures they actually practice coding.
