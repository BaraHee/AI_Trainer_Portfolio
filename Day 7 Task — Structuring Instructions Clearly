11/19/2025

Prompt:

"How do I make a chatbot in Python?"

Response A:

“Use Python and some libraries to make a chatbot.”

Response B:

“To make a chatbot in Python, first choose a library like ChatterBot or NLTK. Start by defining simple question-answer pairs, then expand functionality to handle more complex inputs. Test your chatbot frequently and improve it gradually.”

Evaluation:

Response B is better because:

Provides a step-by-step structure.

Suggests specific tools.

Encourages iteration and testing, which is crucial in learning.

Response A is too vague and won’t guide a beginner effectively.

Reflection:

AI prompts are valuable when they break down complex tasks into clear, actionable steps.
For prompt engineering, practicing how to structure instructions ensures outputs are practical and usable.
