Day 5 Task — Improving a Vague Prompt

11/16/2025
Prompt:

"I tried to code a project but failed several times. I feel frustrated and don’t know what to do next."

Response A:

“Don’t give up. Keep trying, and eventually you will succeed.”

Response B:

“It’s completely normal to fail when learning something new. Take a short break, review your mistakes, and try small steps. Focus on understanding the logic rather than finishing the whole project perfectly. You’re learning, and progress comes one step at a time.”

🔍 Evaluation:

Response B is better because:

It acknowledges the emotional state of the user.

Provides specific steps (break, review mistakes, focus on logic).

Encourages learning mindset rather than just “keep trying.”

Response A is too generic and may not help the person move forward.

📝 Reflection:

AI is more effective when it combines empathy with actionable guidance.
This is a key skill for AI trainers and prompt engineers: designing responses that guide users and support them emotionally.

The third version is the best because it gives full context, specifies the goal, tells the AI the environment (Python), and ensures a complete and accurate answer.

📝 Reflection:

Clarity and context are essential. Vague prompts limit AI, while precise prompts unlock useful answers.
