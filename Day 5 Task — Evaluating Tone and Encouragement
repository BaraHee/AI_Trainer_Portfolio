Day 5 Task — Evaluating Tone and Encouragement
Prompt:

"I tried to code a project but failed several times. I feel frustrated and don’t know what to do next."

Response A:

“Don’t give up. Keep trying, and eventually you will succeed.”

Response B:

“It’s completely normal to fail when learning something new.
Take a short break, review your mistakes, and try small steps.
Focus on understanding the logic rather than finishing the whole project perfectly.
You’re learning, and progress comes one step at a time.”

Evaluation:

Response B is better because:

It acknowledges the emotional state of the user.

Provides specific steps (break, review mistakes, focus on logic).

Encourages learning mindset rather than just “keep trying.”

Response A is too generic and may not help the person move forward.

Reflection:

AI is more effective when it combines empathy with actionable guidance.
This is a key skill for AI trainers and prompt engineers: designing responses that guide users and support them emotionally.

Clarity and context are essential. Vague prompts limit AI, while precise prompts unlock useful answers.
