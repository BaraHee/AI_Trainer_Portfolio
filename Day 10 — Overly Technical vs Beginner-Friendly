Day 10 — Overly Technical vs Beginner-Friendly

📅 11/21/2025

Prompt:

“Explain APIs.”

Response A (technical):

“An API allows communication between software components using RESTful endpoints, JSON payloads, authentication tokens, and CRUD operations.”

Response B (beginner-friendly):

“An API is like a waiter. You tell it what you want, it tells the kitchen, and brings back your food. It lets programs talk to each other easily.”

My choice: Response B — simple, relatable, beginner-friendly.

Reflection:
Audience awareness is critical. Teaching AI to simplify concepts helps beginners learn faster.
