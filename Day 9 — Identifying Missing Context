Day 9 — Identifying Missing Context

📅 11/20/2025

Prompt:

“How do I deploy my project?”

Evaluation:
Too vague. “Project” could be a website, Python script, mobile app, or AI model. Deployment differs per type.

Clarifying questions AI should ask:

What type of project are you deploying?

Which programming language/framework?

Deployment environment (local, cloud, mobile)?

Manual or automated deployment?

Any performance or security requirements?

Reflection:
As a prompt engineer, I realize context is key. Without it, AI answers are often useless.
