Day 3 Task: Evaluating AI Responses for Completeness and Relevance

November 13, 2025

Response A:
You should start by learning Python basics. 
Begin with variables, loops, and functions. 
Then move on to more advanced topics like classes, file handling, and modules. Use online tutorials and practice exercises regularly.

Response B:
Don’t worry, getting started with Python is easier than you think! 😄 Begin with the basics: variables, loops, and functions. 
Try small exercises every day, like creating simple programs. Once comfortable, explore more advanced topics like classes and modules. Remember, practice is key — take it step by step and enjoy the process!

Which response is better?

For today’s task, I prefer Response B — but not because it’s perfect. I actually didn’t like either answer very much.

Why?

Both responses were too generic. Yes, they’re straightforward, and maybe that’s what the user wanted, but personally if I asked this question, I’d want more detail.

For example, I’d ask:

Where do I learn?

What websites are good?

How do I start if I’m a total beginner?

Not everyone asking is a young tech-savvy person. It could be a 40 or 50-year-old with low to zero technology skills who still wants to learn programming. So future GPT responses should adapt to that.

How I would prefer GPT to answer:

Something like:

Hey, learning Python is actually easy — it’s one of the simplest and most popular programming languages.
Here’s a clear breakdown of what you’ll learn:

Beginner:

Variables & data types

Input/output

Comments

Basic math operations

for loops

while loops

Loop control (break, continue, pass)

Intermediate:

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Encapsulation

Class & static methods

Magic methods

Expert:

Decorators

Generators

Comprehensions (master them)

Closures

Context managers

Async programming

“Would you like me to build a full Python roadmap for you?”

This is the kind of answer I’d want — detailed, structured, realistic guidance.
