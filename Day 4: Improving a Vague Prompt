Day 4 Task — Improving a Vague Prompt

📅 11/15/2025



Original prompt:

“Explain how to use models.”



Why this prompt is bad:



The word “models” is extremely vague. It could mean:

AI models

Statistical models

3D models

Fashion models

Database models

Business models



With no context, the AI has no way to understand what the user actually wants.

This leads to weak, generic, or completely incorrect responses.



Improved versions of the prompt:



-Basic clarified version

“Explain how to use a machine learning model to make predictions.”



-More detailed version

“Explain how to load and use a trained machine learning model in Python to 

make predictions on new data.”



-Professional, full-context version

“Provide a step-by-step guide on preprocessing data, loading a trained machine learning model, and performing inference using Python.”



Which is the best and why?



The third version is the strongest because:

It adds full context

It specifies the goal (inference)

It tells the AI the exact environment (Python)

It ensures the answer will be complete and accurate

This is the kind of prompt that removes ambiguity and leads to precise responses.



My Reflection:

Today’s task showed me how important clarity and context are in prompting.

Vague prompts limit the AI — clear prompts unlock better, more useful answers.
